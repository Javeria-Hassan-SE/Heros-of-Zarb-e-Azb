“<br><center>It's a matter of great privilege and honor to be commanding such an accomplished
 <br>and battle hardened Army, We will not stop unless we achieve our end objective of a terror free Pakistan.</center>”
<br>— Pakistan Army Chief, General Raheel Sharif

<br>One and a half years after the start of Zarb-e-Azb, phenomenal successes were achieved,
 <br> with the last pockets close to the Pakistan-Afghan border being cleared. 
<br> Terrorist backbone broken and structure dismantled. 
<br>Nexus with sleeper cells largely disrupted. Intelligence based Operations (IBOs) busted remaining 
<br>sleeper cells. 3,400 terrorists were killed, with 837 hideouts from where they 
<br>were carrying out terrorist activities destroyed.During the last 18 months over 13,200 IBOs 
<br>carried out across the country in which 183 terrorists were killed, 2,193 arrested. IBOs continue. 
<br> 488 officers and men of Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps KPK, Baluchistan, Rangers Sindh
<br> were killed and 1,914 injured in Operation Zarb-e-Azb. 
<br>Total 11 military courts. 142 cases referred to military courts. 
<br> 55 cases decided, 87 cases in process. 31 terrorists convicted. In July,
<br> the Pakistan Army Chief, General Raheel Sharif visited the military's 
<br>forward-most positions near the Afghan border in North Waziristan.
<br>He was briefed about the progress and future plans for Operation Zarb-e-Azb. 
<br>Sharif also visited South Waziristan and Wana agencies. 
<br>It was reported that the Pakistani military had just completed the preliminary preparations for final phase. 
<br> In the area around Shawal, peaks were cleared. 
Management of displaced civilians
<br>As a result of the operation, 929,859 displaced civilians (from 80,302 families) were registered by Pakistani authorities
<br> as of 14 July Financial support, relief goods and food packages were being distributed
<br> and 59 donation points were established across Pakistan by the army. 
<br> On 10 July, the Foreign Office of Pakistan said that the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons 
<br>was an internal matter and reiterated that Pakistan had not requested international assistance. 
<br> <center>"We have very clear instructions from the prime minister [to not seek external assistance], 
<br>Pakistan has neither made nor intends to make a request for international assistance. 
<br> It has been made very clear that all expenditure related to temporarily displaced 
<br>Pakistanis will be met from our own resources"</center>
<br> Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson Tasnim Aslam said. 
<br>However, 
<br>it was reported that the United States allocated $31 million for IDP
<br> and an additional $9.3 million for health, hygiene, water and sanitation for IDPs and livestock. 
<br> It was also reported that the United Arab Emirates government allocated $20.5 million in IDP humanitarian aid
<br> In February 2014, the Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told a visiting US Senator 
<br>Jack Reed that the cost of the operation so far had reached ?40 billion 
<br>(US$380 million) and could go as high as ?130 billion (US$1.2 billion). 
Return of the IDPs
<br>On 8 December 2014, the military approved the phased repatriation of the IDPs. 
<br> The Pakistani army chief said <br><center>the early return of the IDPs was his top priority</center>. 
<br>According to senior military officials, civilian authorities were directed to plan the return of the IDPs
<br> to their homes in areas which have been cleared of terrorists. 
<br>On 31 March 2015, the repatriation started. On the first day, 
<br>219 IDPs belonging to 62 families left Bannu for Spinwam and Shahmeri in North Waziristan. 
<br>In the first phase till 24 April, about 1,200 families were to return to their homes 
<br>in Sinwam, Shamiri, Mirali and Bubali areas of NWA. 
<br> Each family was given ?25000 (US$240) as cash assistance and ?10000 (US$95) as transportation expenses at Mirzail.
 <br> Food ration for six months and non-food items would also be given to each household. For effective disease control, 
<br>children under five years of age were administered anti-polio vaccines and 
<br>under 10 years of age were administered anti-measles vaccines.
 <br> As of 4 May 2015, only 230 displaced families had returned since the launch of the repatriation programme. 
<br><center>"The civil administration can send entire displaced 
<br>population back to their homes within a month if the area is de-notified as conflict zone," </center>
<br>said an official dealing with IDPs repatriation. 
<br>According to the official sources, the cut-off date for the return of IDPs was December 2016.
