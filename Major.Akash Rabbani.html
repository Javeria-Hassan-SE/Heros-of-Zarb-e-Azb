<h1>CAPTIAN AKASH RABBANI     (SHAHEED)</h1><hr><hr>
<b>Captain Akash Rabbani,</b> who was killed by militants in Mirali, was laid to rest with full military honour 
<br>in his ancestral graveyard in<b><i> Habibullah Colony near PMA Kakul, Abbottabad.</i></b>
<br>The funeral prayers of the<b><i> 25-year-old SSG officer </i></b>were attended by high ranking army officers,
<br> relatives and people from all walks of life at Frontier Force Regiment Centre Ground.
<br>Capt Akash was killed in exchange of fire with militants in the ongoing military operation Zarb-i-Azb in Mirali 
<br>tehsil of North Waziristan Agency on Tuesday.
<br>Capt Akash,  was born on <b>20th October 1990.</b> He was very sharp and intelligent since childhood. 
<br>His elder brother, Dr Danish is doing house job in Ayub Medical College, whereas younger sister is a student 
<br>of 2nd year in the same college. Dr Aftab, the head of medicines department in Ayub Medical Complex Abbottabad,
<br>  told that his father was inspired by Allama Iqbal therefore, when Akash was born, he was given this  name 
<br>keeping in view the depth and universality coupled with a sweet sense . Following the foot prints of his family, 
<br>Kashi (nick of Akash) also scored high marks in Matriculation and FSc and had a chance to easily clinch a seat 
<br>in a medical college to become a doctor. But, he was destined to bring laurels for his parents, and the country, 
<br>in a unique way therefore profession of arms turned his ultimate passion into his destiny. 
<br>His performance was remarkable in PMA and he was <b>commissioned </b>on <b>19 April 2011 in 47 Field Artillery,</b> 
<br>which was stationed at Kharian. His performance remained outstanding during his basic course,
<br> but his motivation took him to Special Services Group (SSG) to pursue his carrier. He joined <b>SSG </b>
<br>in 2013 and after successful training, he joined 4 Commando at Tarbela. 
<br>His unit was tasked to spearhead operation Zarb- e- Azb in North Waziristan Agency.
<br>Dr Rabbani says<b><i> "Akash has become my introduction and identity, wherever I go,"</i></b> 
<br><i>"Akash Rabbani studied at Abbottabad Public School. He was a brilliant student throughout his academic carrier,"</i>
<br>According to his father;  He said Akash wanted to do something for his motherland.
<br>Recalling the last two months of his son’s life, Dr Rabbani said that he had invited the family members 
<br>at different functions held at his unit and was very happy from his job. He said that his son always used to say that 
<br>he was enjoying his service with full professional zeal.
<br>Dr Rabbani said that his son was young and energetic. It was just beginning of his life, he added.
<br><b><i> "We all family members had many dreams for him but the honour he received is something different."</i></b>
<br>Dr Rabbani said that they were proud of him and his success.<i> "Akash told us about his first major success in Miramshah 
<br>when security forces traced a training centre of suicide bombers."</i>
<br>Dr Rabbani said that his son wanted to bring peace to the country and free the country from the militants.
<br><b><i>"The day is not far when efforts and sacrifices rendered by the sons of soil like Akash will bear fruits and Pakistan 
<br>will be put on the path of progress and development."</i></b>
<br>Capt Akash was nephew of<b> DIG Nisar Tanoli, EDO Dr Javed Tanoli </b>and former </b>nazim Shaukat Tanoli.</b>
<br> He was the younger brother of<b> <i>Dr Danish Rabbni.</i></b>
<br>Marka was the last place known as the most notorious hideout of the terrorists in the city and Rabbani's Battalion 
<br>was given responsibility to clear the area. 
<br>On <b>15th July, in Boya Degan (Mirali),</b> Capt Rabbani was assigned a mission to clear off area from the terrorists. 
<br>In completion of the assigned tasks, he led his men from the front and in due course, embraced <b>shahadat</b> 
<br>while fighting fearlessly against the ferocious terrorists. He undoubtedly wrote a glorious chapter of Zarb-e-Azb 
<br>with his blood and left lasting impression for others to follow.
<br>Later a floral wreaths ob the behalf of President of Pakistan, Prime Minister, COAS and his unit were laid on his grave. 
<br>
