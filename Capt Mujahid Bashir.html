<h1> CAPTAIN MUJAHID BASHIR </h1><hr><hr>
<br><br>
<br>Many Pakistan army personnel are losing lives in the military operations in northern <br><br>parts of the country against extremist groups; their families mourn while others <br>celebrate Eid ul Fitr.
<br>Eid celebrations marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan this year aren't so <br>joyful for the newly-married wife of Captain Mujahid Bashir, who had embraced <br>martyrdom on July 12, 2014 in Bajaur Agency. 
<br>"I got married 6 months ago on January 12, 2014. I was desperately waiting for our first <br>Eid together; now it will be spent in darkness," said Saliha, the widow of Captain <br>Mujahid, in Islamabad.
<br>"Everything was fine. Mujahid had taken leave and was coming home after one week for <br>Eid vacations. We had also prepared his room when we all of a sudden got the news of <br>his martyrdom," said Tahira, the sister of Captain Mujahid, with sad face.
<br>"Our Eid festivity is with sorrows and grief," said father Muhammad Bashir dissolving in <br>heavy tears.
<br>The family of martyred Captain Mujahid feels gratified over the martyrdom in the holy <br>month of fasting.
<br>"Defending the country is an honourable thing. Soldiers take up to defend their country. <br>For the country they put their life at stake and it is called martyrdom," said younger <br>brother Muhammad Shahid with pride.
<br>Talking to The Nation, the overwhelming emotions of Nazira Bibi, the mother of Captain <br>Muhahid, on her son's death were visible.
<br>"Mujahid used to call me and say Ammi please pray that God Almighty bless me with <br>shahadat. And I used to say my son please don't say like this. I want to see your kids in <br>my life. I haven't slept from the day of his death. When I close my eyes, I see his face in <br>front of my eyes," she said.
<br>Saliha Mujahid had a sad face, with plain white clothes but lighting up as she was <br>recalling her short and happy time with her husband.
<br>"My Eid preparations were high as it was our first Eid together and Mujahid was finally <br>coming from hard area permanently. I had given Eid clothes to tailor and Mujahid and I <br>had planned so many things for Eid," Saliha said.
<br>"My heart cries every time I see my sister-in-law in state of shock and trauma. She wakes <br>up in the middle of night and weeps, and her eyes have swollen dry because of crying," <br>Tahira said.
<br><br>"Our lives have completely changed. We no longer feel any happiness; feel hunger, <br>or even sleep. When someone dies, we think we feel the pain but no, we don't. Nobody <br>can feel until their loved one goes away for ever." Father of the martyred Captain <br><br>Mujahid said and started weeping with a loud cry.
<br><br>"Mujhaid's mother and I are very old and sick. I buried my son with my own hands. I <br>cannot express the pain in my heart in my words," he added.
<br><br>The sweetness of Eid festival has been changed into heart breaking memories in the <br>house of the late military officer.  "Mujhaid Bhai's birthday was on July 8. We had <br>arranged a birthday party for him on Eid. Our all excitements have become gloomy without <br>him," said younger brother Shahid Bashir.
<br><br>"It still seems like a dream. And we sometimes think Mujahid will come home to <br>celebrate Eid with us," Tahira said with eyes full of tears.

<br><br>

<br>Captain Mujahid Bashir, who was martyred in a cross-border attack in Bajaur Agency, was <br>laid to rest in a local graveyard in Islamabad on Sunday.  A high number of relatives, <br>military officials and members of the general public attended his funeral prayers held in <br>Sector G/9. Speaking to the media, Bashir’s father said he was proud of his son who sacrificed <br>his life for God and country. He said Mujahid’s sacrifice for Pakistan has raised the status <br>of his family and they could not be more proud of him. Three security personnel were <br>martyred when militants from Afghanistan attacked a Pakistani check-post in Bajaur <br>Agency on Saturday. Security sources said the militants attacked a check-post in the border <br>area of Ghakhipas, in Mamond tehsil of the agency from Afghanistan’s Kunar province. As <br>a result, a captain and two soldiers were killed and two others sustained injuries.
