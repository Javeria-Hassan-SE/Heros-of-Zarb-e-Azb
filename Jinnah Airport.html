<p>Jinnah Airport Attack</p>
</center>

<br><br>
<h3>LOCATION:</h3>
<br><center>"Location of Jinnah International Airport (KHI) in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan".</center>
<br><b>DATE:</b>
Date :	8 June 2014 (PKT)
<br>On 8 June 2014, 10 militants armed with automatic weapons, a rocket launcher, suicide vests, 
<br>and grenades attacked Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Pakistan. 36 people were killed, 
<br>including all 10 attackers, and 18 others were wounded. The militant organisation Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) 
<br>initially claimed responsibility for the attack. According to state media, the attackers were foreigners of 
<br>Uzbek origin who belonged to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Al Qaeda-linked militant organisation 
<br>that works closely with TTP. The TTP later confirmed that the attack was a joint operation they executed with the IMU, 
<br>who independently admitted to having supplied personnel for the attack.
<br>Following the attack, the Pakistani military conducted a series of aerial strikes on militant hideouts in the tribal areas 
<br>along the Afghan border. At least 25 militants were killed on 10 June, including foreign fighters.Two drone attacks 
<br>on 12 June also killed Uzbek, Afghan and some local militants. On 15 June, the Pakistani military intensified air strikes 
<br>in North Waziristan, and bombed eight foreign militant hideouts. At least 105 insurgents were reported killed, 
<br>a majority of whom were Uzbeks, including those linked to the airport attack. Some other foreign militants were also 
<br>reported killed. According to military sources, a key Uzbek commander and mastermind of the attack, 
<br>Abu Abdur Rehman Almani, was killed in the operation. These military responses culminated in Operation Zarb-e-Azb, 
<br>a comprehensive Pakistan Armed Forces operation against militants in North Waziristan.
<br><br>
<h3>BACKGROUND:</h3>
<br><br>Jinnah International Airport is Pakistan's largest and busiest airport, and serves as the hub for 
<br>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the national flag carrier of Pakistan. Many domestic and international flights transit 
<br>through the airport daily. This attack was the first large-scale incident in the airport in years, with the last major incident 
<br>being the hijacking of the Pan Am Flight 73 in 1986. Earlier in 2011, a similar attack had taken place on the Mehran naval 
<br>airbase in Karachi, and in 2012, the Bacha Khan International Airport in Peshawar, northwest Pakistan, 
<br>was attacked by militants.
<br><br><h3>OCCURANCE:</h3>
<br>Date:	8 June 2014 to 9 June 2014
<br><br><b>Summary: Terrorist attack:</b>
<br><br><b>Site: Jinnah International Airport, Karachi</b>
<br>The attack began at 11:10 PM on 8 June and lasted until the morning around 4:00 AM of 9 June. 
<br>Ten attackers divided in 2 groups, stormed at two different checkpoint and attacked the cargo 
<br>terminal of the airport with automatic weapons, hand grenades, rocket-propelled grenades,
<br> and other explosives. The attackers were dressed as security guards, with some also wearing suicide vests. 
<br>They were wearing uniforms of the Airports Security Force (ASF).A senior Pakistani intelligence official said
<br> some of the militants tried to hijack a plane, but were unsuccessful.
<br>Airports Security Force troops fought back, limited the terrorists attack and started taking them out one by one.
<br> Within 2 hours, eight of the ten militants were shot dead by the Airports Security Force troops and the 
<br>remaining two blew themselves up when they were cornered. About 90 minutes after the attack began,
<br> hundreds of Rangers, Police and Army troops arrived on the scene but the majority of terrorists had 
<br>already been eliminated by Airports Security Force. The siege officially ended after five hours; 28 people, 
<br>including the ten terrorists, 12 ASF personnel, one Pakistan Rangers personnel, a Sindh Police official, 
<br>and four PIA employees (including two senior aircraft engineers) were killed in the incident. 
<br>At least 18 security personnel were also injured in the attack and admitted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. 
<br>Seven bodies that were burnt beyond recognition were also recovered from the airport's cold storage facility 
<br>after a 28-hour rescue operation.
<br>Two aircraft of PIA (a Boeing 747 and an Airbus A310) and one Air Indus (B737) plane were reported damaged.
<br> The PIA did not initially elaborate on damage incurred by its aircraft, although sources reported that the planes 
<br>had either been hit by bullets or shrapnel pieces and received minor damages. Two cargo warehouses stored with 
<br>NATO Supplies i.e. jeeps, drones, medicines and explosives to be exported to Afghanistan caught fire and took 
<br>4 days to get reduced to ashes. During the time the warehouse was on fire, multiple explosions were heard inside 
<br>from time to time. After the attack, the airport was cleared and handed over to the Civil Aviation Authority and ASF.
<br>Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Abdullah Zaki expressed reservations over the security 
<br>situation and its economic impact:
 <br><center>"The situation continues to worsen and the overall insecurity of this city can exactly be gauged from 
<br>the recent airport assault. Under the prevailing circumstances, even domestic travellers are afraid of visiting 
<br>Karachi due to the airport attack whereas the rising lawlessness across the city along with live coverage of 
<br>such incidents by TV channels is likely to keep foreigners, particularly the businessmen and investors, 
<br>away from Pakistan."</center>
<br>Both PIA aircraft were written off due to damage sustained.
<br><br><h3>ASF-ACADEMY ATTACK:</h3>
<br><br>On 10 June, just two days after the airport attack, two to four unidentified militants opened fire near an Airports 
<br>Security Force academy in Pehlwan Goth, Karachi, following which they retreated from Pehlwan Goth. Pehlwan 
<br>Goth is a rundown area that is considered a hub of criminal elements, with police and rangers having previously 
<br>conducted several raids in the area following increased incidence of targeted killings in Karachi in 2011.
<br>Security forces soon launched a search operation in the area, during which two people were detained. 
<br>No casualties and injuries were reported in the attack, and no breach of fence occurred. Flight operations 
<br>were temporarily suspended at Jinnah International Airport for an hour due to the news, with flights being 
<br>diverted to other cities, before resuming again. The Director-General of Sindh Rangers described the attack 
<br>as a hit-and-run incident aimed to create panic. The TTP accepted responsibility for the incident.
<br><br><h3>RESPONSIBILITY:</h3><br>
<br>The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack, describing it as retaliation for the death 
<br>of its former chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in North Waziristan in a drone attack in November 2013.
<br> The TTP also confirmed that the perpetrators were foreigners of Uzbek ethnicity, belonging to the Islamic Movement 
<br>of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Al Qaeda-affiliated organisation that works closely with TTP and is banned by several 
<br>governments including Pakistan. TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid Ponka the attack as a joint operation of TTP and IMU.
<br> In an online statement, the IMU accepted its role in the attack, claiming it as a revenge for Pakistani military operations
<br> against Uzbeks and other foreign militants,and provided photographs of the ten Uzbek fighters who participated in the 
<br>airport attack. In the photographs, the militants were seen wearing green tunics and white trainers while carrying 
<br>assault rifles in what appeared to be a mountainous region. The men looked young and in their early 20s. 
<br>According to Pakistani defence analyst Imtiaz Gul, foreigners including IMU fighters had fled Afghanistan 
<br>following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, and had established a presence in the tribal areas along the Afghan border. 
<br>They enjoy protection and shelter of the TTP and also provide footsoldiers for TTP's operations. 
<br>Uzbek militants have previously been involved in large-scale attacks in Pakistan, including the attack 
<br>on Bacha Khan International Airport in Peshawar in 2012, the attack on PNS Mehran airbase in Karachi in 2011, 
<br>and the orchestration of jail break in Bannu in 2012 and in Dera Ismail Khan on 29 July 2013.
<br>Taliban commander Abdullah Bahar dismissed the Pakistani government's recent offer of peace talks as a 
<br><center><b>  "tool of war"</b> </center>
<br>and, in a reference to Pakistani air strikes against militants, claimed the Pakistani government killed
<br>                            <center><b>"hundreds of tribal women and children". </b> </center>
<br>He also warned of more attacks against the state.
<br>TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid explained why the airport was targeted:
       <br><center> <b>    "We chose a location where there would be less civilian and more official casualties."</b> </center>
<br> Shahid warned the group will engage 
<br><center><b> "in a full-out war with the Pakistani state, starting on June 10."</b> </center>
<br>But                    <center><b>"if even now the Pakistani government backs down,"</b> </center>
<br> Shahid said;      <center><b> "we are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue".</b> </center>
<br>Shahid added that <center><b> "the main goal of this attack was to cut off the supply to NATO Troops in Afghanistan."</b> </center>
