<center><h1>HISTORY OF OPERATION ZARB-E-AZB</h1><hr>
<br><br>
<img src="Operation.jpg"width="50%"height="200px"></center>
<br><br><br>

<div class="history">
Operation Zarb-e-Azb was a joint military offensive conducted by the Pakistan Armed
 Forces against various militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),
the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement,
 Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,Al-Qaeda, Jundallah and the Haqqani network.The operation was 
launched on 15 June 2014 in North Waziristan along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border
 as a renewed effort against militancy in the wake of the 8 June attack on Jinnah
International Airport in Karachi, for which the TTP and the IMU claimed responsibility.
As of 14 July 2014, the operation internally displaced about 929,859 people belonging
to 80,302 families from North Waziristan.
Part of the war in North-West Pakistan, up to 30,000 Pakistani soldiers were involved
in Zarb-e-Azb, described as a <p>"comprehensive operation"</p> to flush out all foreign and
local militants hiding in North Waziristan.The operation has received widespread support
 from the Pakistani political, defence and civilian sectors. As a consequence, the overall
 security situation improved and terrorist attacks in Pakistan dropped to a six-year low
since 2008. Zarb-e-Azb was followed by Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad which began in February
 2017, following a resurgence in terrorist incidents.

<h1>ETYMOLOGIES:</h1>
<br>
<center><img src="sword.jpg"width="50%"height="200px"></center>
<br><br><br>
Zarb-e-Azb<p>(ضربِ عضب)</p> means:<br>
                   <p>"sharp and cutting strike".</p>
<br><br>
"Azb" also refers to the "sword" owned by the Islamic <p>"PROPHET MUHAMMAD(صلى الله عليه وسلم)",</p>
 which he used in the battles of "Badr"  and "Uhud".
<br><br>
<br><br><br>
<h1>STRATEGY:</h1>
<br>
<center><img src="biography of zarb e azb.png"width="50%"height="200px"></center>
<br><br><br>
For the first time, the Pakistani military implemented a military strategy called
"Seek, Destroy, Clear, Hold."The Pakistani military will seek the target. 
Once found, it will be destroyed. When destroyed, the infrastructure, bodies and
 weapons will be cleared and the area will be held both during this time and after its 
completion to ensure post-operation security and infrastructure rebuilding and/or area
 rehabilitation. The Seek and Destroy component is from the Vietnam War whereas the
 Clear and hold component is from the Iraq War. The Pakistani military combined the two
doctrines as a single doctrine for the operation to be successful.
