<h1>PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH TALIBAN:</h1>
<br><br>

<br><br><br>

Peace negotiations with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif after his election,although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed.
 The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and
 the Taliban, was held on<b> 26 March 2014 </b>at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. 
The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban
 religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called for the implementation of
 Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities,
 insisting that talks be held within the framework of the Pakistani constitution. 
A month-long ceasefire was reached on <b>1 March 2014.</b>
<br>
Besides the meetings at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, negotiations also involved helicopter
 travel by government representatives to the areas under militant control near the 
Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The government had indicated that stronger military action
 would be implemented if the talks failed.

<br><br>
<h2>FAILURE:</h2>
<br><br>

Negotiations collapsed after the execution of 23 Pakistani Frontier Corps soldiers by
 the Taliban on 17 February 2014.The soldiers had been held by the insurgents since
 2010, and on 17 April 2014 the TTP formally ended the ceasefire. Taliban infighting 
since March 2014 killed more than 90 militants. The strife, triggered by differences
 between the Mehsud group (led by Sheheryar Mehsud) and another TTP faction 
(led by Khan Said Sajna), impeded the negotiations.The negotiations were irreversibly 
damaged by a terrorist attack on Karachi Airport for which the Taliban claimed
 responsibility and which killed 28 people (including security personnel).
