<h1>CAPT.ASFANDYAR BUKHARI </h1><hr><hr>

<br>LAHORE(Web Desk) – Isfand Yar Bukhari, a captain in Pakistan Army 
<br>embraced shahadat in Badaber, Peshawar today.
Asfandyar joined<b><i> "Cadet College Hasanabdal (CCH)" </i></b>in <b><i>8th grade</i></b> 
<br>and that place helped him a lot on his path. The life at CCH encouraged competitive spirit 
<br>and Asfand just fit in there like a hand in glove. His superb intelligence propelled him to the 
<br>top and he obtained many laurels at CCH. After HSSC father wanted him to pursue a 
<br>medical career but Isfand had his heart set on joining Pakistan Army. At that time his brother 
<br>was against this decision and he enquired  him why he wanted to join army.
 <br>His reply is permanently etched into his brother conscience. He said:
<b><i>" I am only joining army so that I might receive a chance to fight for Allah Almighty."</i></b> 
<br> He graduated at the top of his class from Pakistan Military Academy 
<br>and received the coveted sword of honor. 
<br>He was the vice-captain of his institute’s hockey team.
<br> A chess champion in college, and the president of the Biology Club.
 <br>He was a brave and intelligent young man with a bright future ahead of him.
 <br>He gave his life for the country today.
 
<br>Captain Isfand Yar recieves Sword of Honor at PMA Passing Out Parade

<br>Captain Isfand studied in Cadet College Hassanabdal before joining the army. 
<br>When he graduated from PMA, his school magazine wrote this about him:

<br><center>Isfand Yar Bukhari, Wing Commander Jinnah Wing 48th Entry, 
<br>received Sword of Honor and War Tactics Medal at the passing out parade of 118th Long Course in Pakistan 
<br>Military Academy 118 Long Course, Kakul.
<br> He was also holding the appointment of Battalion Sargeant Under Officer (BSUO) 1st Pak Battalion in PMA.</center>
<br>Isfand Yar was from Jinnah Wing under whom the Wing lifted the Champion’s Trophy.
<br> He was Vice Captain of college hockey team also played hockey in Punjab for the Under-19.
<br> He was also the college chess champion, member of college riding team, 
<br>  president of biology club, associate editor of college magazine,
 <br>  member of board of editors and writers for five years.
He did not want to spend his life in average materialistic pursuits because he believed in a higher purpose. 
<br>Owing to our parents’ Tarbiyat (grooming) Asfand believed that only that<b><i>" life is useful which 
<br>is spent in the service of Allah and Allah alone."</i></b> Then his great degree of self-awareness 
<br>helped point out to him the career which was most suited to his goal. After all he had always been 
<br>very interested in military history and had read the works of Sun Tzu and Clausewitz at a very young age. 
<br>His natural athleticism and his successes in the Cadet life at CCH were also proof that he could be the best
<br> in the army. These qualities wouldn’t have served him better in any other field than the army.
 <br>So he made a rational decision about how he could serve Allah better and then didn’t waver from that decision.
<br> Currently Lt. Isfand Yar Bukhari is serving in Bahawalpur.

<br> Captain Isfand Yar was as good as they get. 
<br>THE WORDS OF CAPT ASFAND YAR
<center><p>I had always prayed that Allah keep him safe because I was aware of his risk-your-neck-to-save-others approach. 
<br>But he had another point of view. He used to tell me frequently :
<br>"Pal! Shahadat is the wild card to Jannat. You just have to keep your niyyat pure".</p></center>
<br>He viewed Shahadat as the end to all the worldly toils and struggles and the perfect expression 
<br>of loyalty to Allah. He had always been outspoken about the damage caused to Islam by the terrorists. 
<br>He used to tell me:
<br><p><center>"Brother! Islam is under fire from both sides. On one side are the half educated pseudo liberals who are 
<br>blind in their imitation of the West. "</p></center>
<br> He was an invaluable asset of this country and the pride and joy of his parents, family and teachers alike. 
<br>He finally got his chance on <b><i>18th September 2015</i></b> when the murderers attacked <b><i>Badaber camp.</i></b> 
<br>At that he was <b><i>G-3 102 Brigade</i></b>.
<br> As military men know that it is a staff officer post and not a field job but Isfand couldn’t waste his chance 
<br>on a technical hitch. He couldn’t let those murderers kill more innocent Muslims on his watch. He couldn’t let 
<br>the history of APS Peshawar be repeated.  He had craved a show down with these apostates for ages, 
<br>how could he waste this chance? He rushed to the field of battle. He was fettered by his staff officer responsibilities.
<br> He was extremely restless. He couldn’t calm himself down. His adrenaline was pumping. 
<br>He wanted to have a go at the murderers and then he got his chance. 
<br>  We have lost many Isfand Yars in the last 15 years of this insane proxy-war.These men cannot be replaced.
<br> The people who caused his shahadat were the same people responsible of the massacre of children of APS. 
<br>  They continue to live in safe-heavens across the border in Afghanistan. 
<br>  Seemingly equipped with unlimited supply of weapons, ammunition, 
<br>  and minds that provide them strategies for guerrilla warfare against Pakistan. 
<br> After tactically destroying TTP on ground in Zarb e Azb, 
<br>  it is time that we destroy these terrorists strategically.
 <br> Their supply of weapons, ammunition, equipment and strategies from Afghanistan and India 
<br> must be exposed in the national and International media in the loudest of voices.
<br> Much has been said about Pakistan’s support for Afghan Taliban in the 80’s and 90’s, 
<br> now it is time to talk about Afghanistan and India’s support for TTP in the last 10-15 years. 
<br> This is the biggest open-secret of this war, and the time has come to expose it.
<br> We owe this debt to Captain Isfand Yar and other great men who have sacrificed their lives in this war.
<br>The head of Urdu Department at Cadet College Hasanabdal Professor Mohammad Zaheer Qindeel decided 
<br>to write a biography of Isfandyar Shaheed titled<b><i> "Marka e Badaber ka Hero" (The Hero of Badaber). 
<br></i></b>The book was officially launched from Cadet college Hasanabdal by the <b><i>Chief of Naval Staff 
<br>Admiral Mohammad Zakaullah </i></b>on 29 April 2017 in a ceremony.
