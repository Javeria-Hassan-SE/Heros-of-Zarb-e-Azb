<h1> <i>Major Wasif</i></h1><hr><hr>
<br><b><i>"Irshad Hussain Shah:"</i></b>(father) - Pakistan armed forces are fighting for the integrity, solidarity, 
defence and peace of Pakistan. In order to achieve these tasks/objectives on one hand army fights against 
terrorists and their originators who are well taught, well equipped and well paid by our neighbouring country 
and others while on the other hand against Indian atrocities on LoC. We are thankful to Almighty God who has 
granted courage to our jawans and officers of army to fight against our enemies with bravery, courage, 
faithfulness and patriotism successfully in unfavorable circumstances. We have countless wonderful examples 
of our jawans and officers who fought with exemplary bravery, gallantly and embraced Shahadat.
With the foregoing aims and objectives for the defence of the country,<b><i> Major Wasif Hussain Shah</i></b> 
embraced Shahadat along with <b><i>Subedar Jahangir </i></b>and three other jawans in Dattakhel NWA on 
<b><i>15 Nov 2014 </i></b>while fighting against about 400 well-organised militants.
<b><i>Major Wasif</i></b> was born on <b><i>2nd may 1981 </i></b>at <b><i>Tarbela Dam.</i></b> 
His father was serving at that time as an officer in WAPDA Tarbela. Major Wasif is from the descendants of 
Syed Kasteer Gul famous as Shaikh Rahmakar Hazrat Kaka Sahib at (Nowshera). Kaka Sahab is from the tribe 
of Imam Hussain (PBUH). The forefathers of Major Wasif travelled to Hazara, Kashmir and Swat for preaching 
Islam and settled at Shaikhabad, Mansehra. Major Wasif’s father is a retired deputy director and former assistant professor of <b><i>Hazara University Mansehra.</i></b>

Zarm Sar ridge in Dattakhel area was very sensitive area and a safe haven for terrorists. 
Army was planning to clear this area since long. This difficult and core vital task was assigned to

<br>On 15 Oct 2014 at about 1700 hours about 400 terrorists from different directions attacked the post Zarm 3.
<br> Major Wasif along with four soldiers moved very quickly and promptly from his own post (Zarm 2) to defend 
<br>his area and to save the lives of his soldiers at Zarm 3. Major Wasif put up intense fight and forced the 
<br>terrorists to retreat with heavy losses.
<br>Due to firing from multiple directions a few soldiers at Zarm 3 got injured and some of them left the 
<br>forward positions. Major Wasif disregarding his personal safety engaged the well-equipped terrorists. 
<br>During the fight the son of the soil received two bullets, one in his left shoulder and the other in clavicle.

<br>plagued with terrorism.”</i></b>
