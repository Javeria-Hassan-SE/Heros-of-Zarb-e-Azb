<b>Director General ISPR Asim Bajwa</b> has said that phenomenal successes have been
 achieved during the one and a half years of Operation Zarb-e-Azb.

In a press release issued on Saturday, he said that <center><p>"last pockets close to Pak-Afghan
 border were being cleared. “Terrorists’ backbone broken and their main infrastructure 
dismantled and nexus with sleeper cells largely disrupted. Intelligence based operations
 (IBOs) are continuing to destroy remaining sleeper cells.”</p></center>

The DG ISPR said that 3,400 terrorists had been killed, while 837 hideouts from where
 they were carrying out their terrorists activities destroyed, 92hdnews reported.

<center><p>“During last 18 months, over 13,200 IBOs have been carried out across the country in 
which 183 hardcore terrorists killed, while 21,193 people arrested,”</p></center> he disclosed. 
“Success has come after a heavy price. 488 valiant officers and men of Pakistan Army, 
Frontier Corps KPK, Balochistan and Rangers Sindh sacrificed their lives and 1,914 injured
 in Operation Zarb-e-Azb.”

DG ISPR Asim Bajwa said that 142 cases had been referred to total 11 military courts. 
“Fifty-five cases have been decided, while 87 cases are in process. As many as 31 hardcore 
terrorists have been convicted,” he maintained.

He said that support of the nation for its valiant armed forces and resolve expressed 
against terrorism after the December 16 Army Public School Peshawar attack had been 
bedrock of Operation Zarb-e-Azb.

“Overall improvement in law and order owed to Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Festivities and 
national events have been celebrated, while stability is being achieved in Karachi,” 
he said.
