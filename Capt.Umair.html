<h1>CAPTAIN UMAIR ABBASI (SHAHEED)</h1>
<br><br>

The graceful, jovial yet competent 27 year old young officer was one of four security personnel who lost their lives during an interchange of fire with militants while carrying out an operation near the Pak-Afghan border.
<br>
His course mate Capt Hamid Fayyaz said,
<br>
<center><i><p>Umair was an extraordinary human being. Time spent with Umair during our PMA training is unforgettable. The whole course feels honoured that such a person was part of our course. It is no mistake that Umair was meant for martyrdom as he was gem of a person. He had cordial relations with everyone. He has the honour of being the first operational martyr of our course who laid down his life for the cause of Pakistan. We will miss him a lot but his martyrdom has laid down the foundation stone for the whole course to follow which is an emblem of bravery, honour and gallantry. His sacrifice will act as a beacon of light for the times to come</center></i></p><br>

The whole nation pays tribute to his parents and family for raising such son of the soil who had made our head high.
<br>
