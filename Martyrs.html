<center><h1>OUR REAL HEROS </h1></center>

<br><br>

The Pakistan armed forces have always sacrificed their best of men in keeping intact the sovereignty of the Motherland as its soil contains as an unforgettable and primary constituent the blood of its martyrs who have fearlessly confronted the enemy and crushed their nefarious designs while guarding their land with their most precious possessions, their lives. 

History has seen how the soldiers of the Pakistan army have risen to their towering 
heights to defend their borders, their land, their deserts, their fertile and rich plains,
 their water and resources against severe enemy aggression as our heroes succeeded to stop 
the opponents not allowing them to touch and advance on even an inch of the country, a 
duty that, the world witnesses, they perform with a complete unwavering faith and courage
 while attaining immortality as<br>
<p> It is stated in the Qur’an: <br><br>
<center>“And do not call those who die 
in the way of Allah as “Dead”, no they are living, only you do not see them. (2:154).</center></p>
<br><br>
The arrival of coffins of our ‘shuhadas’ received by solemn faced colleagues , 
despite being wrapped in green and white stirring a sentiment of pride and honor, 
shows the lifeless form of those who had once been the source of utter joy for their 
loved ones and the vivacious presence of whom was for some, the only reason to be. The
 immense sorrow displayed by the funeral prayers in muted silence, wreaths of eternally
 fragrant flowers that accompany them as the comrades and fellow officers bid them the 
final farewell. Life, unaffected by its grotesque and brutal realms goes on as the people
 progressively become engrossed in the mundane, day to day rituals. Other sacrifices, 
however, are equally important while less dramatic do not have a long term and such 
drastic after effects on the lives of those involved.

No one can, in their pursuits stop and consider the anguish and mental torment endured 
by the wives, children and parents of those who have been martyred or even the hundreds
 and thousands of others who wonder everyday if their dear ones would be the next? 
Uttering a few words of sympathy does not wash away the miseries as none can understand
 the full measure of what they have been, and are still, suffering while fighting a never
 ending battle at the home front as the smooth sailing life boat loses balance and becomes
 retarded. Millions of such episodes have been witnessed and been forgotten as we move 
forward.

Therefore, to salute the soldiers of Pakistan Army who fought showing bravery and 
courage and gave their lives for our great country have been awarded the highest 
military honor the Nishan-i-Haider to those who embraced shahadat in the most heroic 
manner while inflicting heavy damage to the adversary in times of war and battles fought
 on borders. At the age of 38, soon after the birth of Pakistan, during the Kashmir 
operations in 1948, as Company Commander in the 2nd Battalion of the Punjab Regiment,
 Captain Sarwar became a worthy recipient of this military award after he launched an 
attack causing heavy casualties against a strongly fortified enemy position in the Uri
 Sector under heavy machine-gun, grenade and mortar fire, while moving forward with six of his men to cut their way through barbed wires and barriers, he died when his chest was riddled by a burst of automatic fire.

This episode is just the beginning as Pakistan had been involved in three major wars with
 India and various other battles that have taken the precious lives of these valiant sons
 of proud and courageous mothers who play a colossal role in the survival of the nation 
and have to be saluted by the entire nation that has lent stature and tallness to the 
nation enabling it to propel forward.

The Indo-Pakistani conflict in 1965 was fought over Kashmir and started without a formal
 declaration of war. The war began on August 5, the initial battles between India and 
Pakistan were contained within Kashmir involving both infantry and armor units with each
 country’s air force playing major roles while the largest engagement of the war occurred
 in the Sialkot region. Pakistan’s army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but 
suffered great loses of some 3000 troops as our soldiers proved their abilities as one 
Pakistani soldier was equal to four Indian soldiers at that time.

A glorious and cherished example of the fact is the heroic martyrdom of the very famous 
Major Aziz Bhatti, who had been awarded the sword of honor as a cadet carried out his 
duty towards the nation with unconquerable professionalism and dedication an example of
 which can eloquently be explained by an incident occurring a day before his death, in 
which his commanding officer had sent to him word that since he had been fighting
 untiringly for the last six days, he should take a little rest and that another officer
 was being sent to replace him. Major Aziz brimming with battle spirit and the will for
 martyrdom declined the offer to go back and fought till the last drop of his blood was 
shed for his beloved homeland. As the company commander, Major Bhatti chose to move his 
platoon forward under constant firing from Indian tanks and artillery. He resisted for 
five days and nights defending a Pakistani outpost on the strategic BRB canal. On 11 
September, he was reorganizing his company and directing the gunners to shell the enemy
 positions. In order to watch every move of the enemy, he had to place himself in an 
elevated position, where he was exposed to enemy fire. He led his men from the front 
under constant attack from Indian Artillery batteries. Although he countered every Indian
 offensive in his area, he was hit by an enemy tank shell in the chest while watching the
 enemy’s moves, and thus dying instantly. His death struck many hard and is remembered by
 his countrymen and was awarded Nishaan-e-Haider for his utmost commitment and 
determination.


 
The youngest recipient of Nishan-i-Haider, Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas, while still under
 training, was taxiing for take-off on a routine flight on August 20, 1971 when an 

Instructor Pilot forced his way into the rear cockpit, seized control of the aircraft 
and took off. Keeping his wits together, Minhas realized that the intruding pilot was 
heading towards India, he tried to regain control of the aircraft but could not manage
 it against the superior skill and experience of the seasoned instructor. With only forty
 miles to go to cross over into Indian territory, he made yet another effort to steer the 
aircraft back to the base. Realizing the futility of the struggle, he so interfered with 
the controls as to render the Instructor Pilot helpless and force the aircraft to crash 
32 miles short of the border, knowing that it meant certain death. For the supreme 
sacrifice that he made for the honor of his country, Pilot Officer Minhas was awarded
 Nishan-e-Haider.

Furthermore, the martyrs of Kargil have retained and propagated the military tradition of
 unparalleled valiance and bravery without losing their bond with the motherland and its
 security concerns. Captain Karnal Sher Khan emerged as the symbol of mettle and courage 
during the Kargil conflict on the Line of Control, joined those eight legendary heroes who
 received the highest military award of Nishan-e-Haider as he set personal examples of 
bravery and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. Defending five strategic posts he 
repulsed many Indian attacks. Despite many abortive attempts, the enemy ringed the post of
 Capt. Sher Khan with the help of two battalion and unleashed heavy mortar firing and 
managed to capture some part of the post. Crushing the enemy intentions by a counter-attack
 and succeeded in re-capturing the lost parts while embracing shahadat.

Once again our lionhearted valorous soldiers have taken on their strenuous shoulders the 
responsibility of defending the precious homeland from a fresh and recent sprouting of 
internal threat that emanates from the western borders and the Pakistani tribal regions. 
They are forcing the militants and miscreants out and have succeeded in their mission to
 a great extent.

Pakistan is playing the central role in war on terrorism with the help of armed forces as
 it launched two years back Zarb-e-Azb Operation after a number of successful full-fledged
 military operations like Rah-e-Rast followed by Rah-e-Nijaat to fight day and night and 
ensure country’s survival on national as well as global level. The number of the causalties
 in the war is mind-boggling. Pakistan Army has lost more than 50,000 civilians and armed 
forces personnel including the personnel of police, intelligence and law enforcement 
agencies; in addition with their loss of serenity and comfort of homes, while killing 
20,000 terrorists a figure that is increasing steadily day by day as almost 99 percent 
areas have been cleared from the stronghold of terrorists in North Waziristan, 
Khyber Agency and other FATA areas.

In his press briefing on September 1, Lt Gen Asim Salim Bajwa, the Director General of 
ISPR, told foreign and local journalists that the operation is being carried without anhy
 discrimination between the good or bad terrorists. He said the attempt of ISIS to ingress
 into Pakistan has been foiled. Deash Pakistan Commander Hafiz Umer was among thos 309 
apprehended who were trying to establish Daesh network in Pakistan. After making 
significant achievements from the operation Zarb-e-Azb, the focus has now shifted to 
border management. “We are planning to erect 18 gates (crossing points) and around 100 
FC check posts regulate and monitor movement across Pakistan Afghan border. In order to 
control illegal movement across the border, entry to Khyber Agency and Orakzai Agency
 through four passes had been sealed.

Zarb-e-Azb operation has cost Pakistan $106.98 billion while 537 personnel of security 
forces, including 18 officers and 484 jawans embraced shahadat and 3,5000 terrorists were 
also killed..

It has to be made evident that the army has played its due share in the purgation of the
 motherland and its generous sacrifices can be hidden from none. The credit has to be 
awarded to the Pakistan army who has most valiantly countered the terrorist and 
successfully managed to expel all evil and secured the area for the inhabitants who had 
no power of their own. During the operations many militant hideouts were exposed which
 had served as the hub of al-Qaeda networking while capturing most of the militant 
leadership and stopping them from escaping. This has been possible only with the fearless
 and heroic offering of our soldiers who have been kidnapped, slaughtered and imprisoned
 but have rendered the internal enemy as defunct while engaging our age old rivals on the
 eastern borders simultaneously. 

One such example of valiance was seen, while killing 32 militants, after the militants 
ambushed a security forces check post at Kalaya, as six security personnel including Lt
 Colonel Anwar Abbas embraced Shahadat. According to reports Shaheed Colonel Abbas 
received bullet injuries when he himself was going to rescue the soldiers attacked by
 the miscreants. This, and many other glorious models of military sacrificial incidents,
 with which our history is replete, unearth the true patriotic path they follow till they
 breathe their last.

It is also the duty of each individual to pay tribute to them and to join their hands 
with the forces. As the nation is at war and by extending our support and by joining the 
battle we can show that the soldiers are no more solitary in their sacrifices but beside 
them the nation stands entirely and that Pakistani’s all over the world are grateful to 
their grand warriors, the undaunting Trojans of strength who gave up their present for our
 prosperous future.
