<br><br><br>
<br> As the Defense Ministry of Pakistan declared, Operation Zarb-e-Azb is going on 
ground levelas well as with the help of Pakistan air force and air strikes in
North Waziristan has destroyed the hideouts and command and control  system. 
Four drone attacks, during one year have also been used in critical areas, Dattakhel
 and Shawal, which was difficult to overtake by the Pakistan army.  The targeted operation
 Zarb-e-Azb has four objectives:<br>
<br> i. Degrading the terrorist network in number; their integrity, their organizational
 command,  infrastructure,  restoration,  social  network  physically  and intellectually,
 the umbrella of TTP, their master mind, logistic, intelligence, and financial support 
system are destroyed;<br> 
<br> ii. Their assets to protect them  from drones and  their apparatus are  degraded. 
Factories, caves, dunes explosives, training sites, hideouts are destroyed and their arms
 are detained by the army; <br>
<br>iii. Territory, which  was under  their controlled  is 
recaptured or  regain by the Pakistan Army; <br>  


<br>iv. US, Pak cooperation in this operation is good coordinated approach. Pakistan 
with the help of US drone strikes in hardest targets is heading towards its final stage 
of the present military offensive. <br><br><br> The initiation of the 
Operation Zarb-i-Azb, a  military operation in NWA in June; whole scenario has changed. 
Militant attacks have started to decline even before the operation was launched,
 in particular when the government was trying a negotiated  arrangement  with  the  TTP. 
However,  the  operation  itself has  had a striking impact in bringing down assaults and 
devastating militant infrastructure in NWA. Nonetheless, there has been one development 
this year that has changed the scenario  a  great  deal.  However,  concrete  figures 
 are  not  yet  on  hand,  some counter-terrorism experts approximated that attacks have
 come down by around 30pc this year compared to 2013. With the support of whole nation, 
the armed forces of Pakistan are immensely sacrificing  for  the  country;  fighting  
vigilantly  knowing  the  geographical difficulties and complexities of NWA, recapturing 
the territory from the terrorists. COAS said, “It's a matter of great privilege and honor 
to be commanding such an accomplished and battle hardened Army, We will not stop unless we
 achieve our end objective of a terror  free Pakistan”  (The Nation,  July 3, 2015).  The 
armed forces immune the terrorists from Miranshah, Mirali and Tirah valley. The militant 
attacks are down by and large. COAS said  to focus to locating the financing of terror 
groups, garroting all the sources, capturing the sponsors and accomplices. Armed forces 
felt the need that the safe haven of militants in Afghanistan must be cleared from TTP. 
Political stability is needed when the country is going through a dire situation. 
 Outstanding level of success and consistency during the operation are made by  the 
 armed  forces.  The  Chinese  President,  during  his  visit  to  Pakistan demonstrated
  about  Operation  Zab-e-Azb  as  a  ‘game  changer  for  peace  and stability in the 
region. <br>Three factors that contributed in the successful continued operation  are: 
<br><br> <br>1)  careful  planning  along  the  motivation  of  troops  fighting;  
<br><br><br>2) national unity: full mandate and support were given to the armed forces to 
destroy the  terrorist  networks  and  restore  peace  in  NWA;  
<br><br>3)  full  support  of  civilian leadership and political parties after the
 negotiations failed.  According to an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement, 
some 837 safe havens of terrorists have been destroyed and 253 tons of explosives are in 
hold in the operation. The Director General of ISPR, Major General Asim Bajwa on  Twitter
  also  mentioned  347  Pakistan’s  Security  Forces  personnel  accepted martyrdom, which
 also yielded 18,087 weapons, including heavy machine guns, light  machine guns,  sniper 
rifles, rocket launchers  and AK-47s have  also  been recovered  from  the  hideouts  of 
 terrorists.  Thousands  of  militants  with  their accomplices  are  detained  in  
metropolitan  areas  in  9,000  intelligence-based operations (IBOs) and  218 terrorists
 are  killed  (The Express  Tribune,  June 14, 2015).  He  further  validated  that  in 
 FATA,  NWA  and  Khyber  agencies, considerable accomplishment  have been  made. 
“Strongholds of  terrorists,  their communication infrastructure  and  sanctuaries  had 
largely been  cleared” adding 
 

Operation Zarb-e-Azb.
